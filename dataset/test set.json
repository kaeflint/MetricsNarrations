Performance, with respect to classifying the test samples, was assessed based on the following evaluation metrics: F1-score, precision, and accuracy. From the table, these metrics are shown to have identical scores. For predictive accuracy, it scored 55.11%, has a precision score of 54.99%, with the F1-score equal to 54.35%. These scores show that the model has moderate classification performance, and hence will be able to correctly classify the majority of test samples.",
