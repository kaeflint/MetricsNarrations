According to the recall and precision scores, we can assert that the classifier is quite confident with the prediction decisions made across the majority of the test cases belonging to class C2. In fact, it has a moderately low false-positive rate, as indicated by scores achieved for precision and recall. Overall, a very high specificity score of 90.84% and an F1-score of 80.38% indicate a good model for sorting out the unseen instances belonging to classes C1 and C2.",
