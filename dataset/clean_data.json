This is shown by the very high scores achieved across the Accuracy, Recall, AUC, and Precision evaluation metrics. With an AUC of 97.91, the model is nearly perfect in regards to predictions across the majority of the new or unseen cases. The model has a very low error rate as indicated by the accuracy.",
