the performance of the model on this multi-class classification problem where the test instances are classified as either # ca or # cb or # ca is : accuracy ( 86.21 % ) , precision ( 72.84 % ) , and finally , an f1score of 79.65 % . these scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective enough to sort between the examples belonging to the three classes . furthermore , from the precision and f2score , we can estimate that the likelihood of misclassifying any given test example is quite small which is impressive but not surprising given the distribution of
