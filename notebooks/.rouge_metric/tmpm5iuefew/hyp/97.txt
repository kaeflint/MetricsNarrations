the machine learning model trained on this multi-class classification problem ( where a given test observation is labeled as either # ca or # cb or # ca ) achieves high scores across all the metrics under consideration . for the accuracy , it scored 73.78 % , for the precision score equal to 79.09 % . judging based on these scores , we can conclude that the model performs fairly well in terms of correctly predicting the true label for most of the test examples .
