the scores achieved by the model on this binary classification task are as follows ( 1 ) accuracy equal to 85.24 % ( 2 ) sensitivity score ( sometimes referred to as the recall score ) is 81.03 % . ( 3 ) precision score of 88.99 % . ( 4 ) f1score of 84.82 % . these scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly classifying most test cases / samples with only a small margin of error . furthermore , the f1score and accuracy show that the likelihood of misclassifying any given test example is marginal .
