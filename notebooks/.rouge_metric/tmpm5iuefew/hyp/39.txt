the scores achieved by the model on this binary classification task are as follows ( 1 ) accuracy equal to 74.67 % ( 2 ) sensitivity score is 63.81 % with a precision score of 77.91 % ( 4 ) specificity of 84.17 % . according to the recall and precision scores , these scores are lower than expected , indicating how poor the performance is at correctly generating the true label for most test cases related to any of the class labels under consideration . however , looking at the specificity score , we can say that the likelihood of misclassification is small , which is impressive but not surprising given the distribution in the dataset across the classes .
