the scores achieved by the model on this binary classification task are as follows : ( 1 ) accuracy equal to 70.22 % ( 2 ) specificity score of 67.52 % , ( 3 ) f1score of 71.83 % , and ( 4 ) f2 - score ( calculated based on the precision and f1score ) . from these scores , we can conclude that this model has a moderate classification performance and will likely misclassify some test samples drawn randomly from any of the classes . however , considering the difference between the specificity and f2score , the confidence in predictions related to the label # ca is very high .
