the classifier's performance on this binary classification problem where the test instances are classified as either # ca or # cb is : accuracy ( 74.08 % ) , recall ( 74.51 % ) , and finally , an f1score of 74.2 % . these scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly labeling most test cases belonging to any of the class labels . however , looking at the precision and recall scores , we can see that the likelihood of misclassifying any given test case is marginal .
