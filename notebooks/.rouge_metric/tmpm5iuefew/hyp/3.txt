the scores achieved by the model on this multi-class classification problem where the test instances are classified as either # ca or # cb or # ca are : accuracy ( 62.5 % ) , recall ( 63.49 % ) , precision ( 66.95 % ) , and finally , an f1score of 62.07 % . these scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly labeling most test cases / samples with only a small margin of error .
