the scores achieved by the model on this binary classification task are as follows ( 1 ) accuracy equal to 82.21 % ( 2 ) sensitivity score ( i . e . recall ) is 75.88 % with a precision score of 87.51 % and ( 4 ) f1score of 77.95 % . these scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly labeling most test cases belonging to any of the class labels under consideration . furthermore , from the auc and accuracy scores , we can see that the likelihood of misclassification is quite small , which is impressive but not surprising given the distribution in the dataset between the classes .
