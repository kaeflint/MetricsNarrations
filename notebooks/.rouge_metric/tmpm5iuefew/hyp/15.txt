the scores achieved by the model on this binary classification task are as follows : accuracy ( 86.59 % ) , recall ( 56.91 % ) , precision ( 25.07 % ) , and finally , an f1score of 25.1 % . these scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly labeling most test cases belonging to any of the class labels . however , looking at the precision and recall scores , we can see that the likelihood of misclassifying any given test case is marginal .
