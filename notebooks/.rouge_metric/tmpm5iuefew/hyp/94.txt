the performance of the model on this multi-class classification problem where the test instances are classified as either # ca or # cb or # ca is : accuracy ( 73.78 % ) , recall ( 74.64 % ) , and finally , an f1score of 72.87 % . these scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly predicting the true labels for several test cases / samples with a small margin of error .
