the performance of the model on this multi-class classification problem where the test instances are classified as either # ca or # cb or # ca is : accuracy ( 72.01 % ) , recall ( 72.56 % ) , precision ( 73.06 % ) , and finally , an f1score of 71.54 % . these scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly labeling most test cases with only a few misclassification instances .
