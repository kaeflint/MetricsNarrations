the scores achieved by the model on this binary classification task are as follows ( 1 ) accuracy equal to 79.25 % ( 2 ) specificity score of 89.38 % ( 3 ) sensitivity score ( 59.81 % ) is only marginally higher than the proportion of the majority class ( # ca ) with the moderately high precision and specificity scores . judging by these scores attained , it is fair to conclude that this model can accurately separate the examples under the different classes with a small margin of misclassification error .
