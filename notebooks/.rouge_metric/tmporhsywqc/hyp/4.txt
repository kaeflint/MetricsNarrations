the scores achieved by the model on this binary classification task are as follows ( 1 ) accuracy equal to 86.11 % ( 2 ) auc score equal 90.09 % ( 3 ) sensitivity score ( sometimes referred to as the recall score ) is 84.29 % with a precision score of 89.07 % . these scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly labeling most test cases belonging to any of the classes . furthermore , from the precision and sensitivity scores , we can assert that the likelihood of misclassifying any given test example is quite small , which is impressive but not surprising given the distribution in the dataset between the class labels under consideration .
