the scores 85.32 % , 85.24 % , 88.99 % , and 81.03 % , respectively , are the evaluation metrics' scores achieved by the model trained to classify test samples under one of the two-class labels ( # ca and # cb ) . from the scores across the different metrics under consideration , we can conclude that this model has a moderately high classification performance and will be highly effective at correctly predicting the true label for several test cases / instances .
