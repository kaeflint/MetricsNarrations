the scores achieved by the model on this multi-class classification problem where the test instances are classified as either # ca or # cb or # ca are 53.33 % ( accuracy ) , 52.07 % ( recall score ) , and finally , an f1score of 50.71 % . these scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly labeling most test cases belonging to any of the class labels . furthermore , from the precision and recall scores , we can see that the likelihood of misclassifying any given test case is very low .
