the classification performance of the algorithm regarding this binary classification problem where the test instances are classified as either # ca or # cb is : accuracy ( 72.44 % ) , precision ( 79.45 % ) , and recall ( 55.24 % ) . from these scores , we can see that the precision and recall scores are lower than expected , indicating how poor the model is at correctly generating the true class label for most test cases related to class # ca .
