the scores achieved by the model on this binary classification task are as follows ( 1 ) accuracy equal to 72.59 % ( 2 ) sensitivity score ( i . e . recall ) is 72.36 % with a precision score of 72.12 % and ( 4 ) f1score of 72.29 % . these scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective in terms of its predictive power for the majority of test cases / samples . furthermore , the precision and recall scores show that the likelihood of misclassifying any given test case is small , which is impressive but not surprising given the data is balanced between the classes .
