the scores achieved by the model on this binary classification task are as follows ( 1 ) accuracy equal to 78.22 % ( 2 ) sensitivity score ( i . e . recall score ) is 82.86 % with a precision score of 73.73 % . ( 4 ) specificity score is 74.17 % . the f1score , specificity and sensitivity scores indicate that the likelihood of misclassifying test samples is small , which is impressive but not surprising given the distribution of the data across the two class labels . overall , this model has moderately high confidence in its prediction decisions .
