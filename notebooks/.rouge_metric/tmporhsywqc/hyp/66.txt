the scores achieved by the model on this binary classification task are as follows ( 1 ) accuracy equal to 86.21 % ( 2 ) sensitivity score ( i . e . recall ) is 74.81 % with a precision score of 84.07 % and ( 4 ) f1score of 79.17 % . these scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective in terms of its predictive power for the majority of test cases / samples . furthermore , the f2score shows that the likelihood of misclassifying test samples is small which is impressive but not surprising given the data is balanced between the classes .
