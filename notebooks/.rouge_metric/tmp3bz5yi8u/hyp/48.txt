the classifier's performance on this multi-class classification problem where the test instances are classified as either # ca or # cb or # ca is : accuracy ( 55.11 % ) , precision ( 54.65 % ) , and finally , an f1score of 54.35 % . these scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly labeling most test cases with only a small margin of error ( actually , the likelihood of misclassification is small ) .
