the scores achieved by the model on this binary classification task are as follows ( 1 ) accuracy equal to 71.11 % ( 2 ) sensitivity score ( i . e . recall ) is 72.38 % with a specificity score of 70.02 % . these scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly labeling most test cases belonging to any of the class labels under consideration . furthermore , from the f1score and sensitivity scores , we can see that the likelihood of misclassifying any given test case is small which is impressive but not surprising given the data is balanced between the classes .
