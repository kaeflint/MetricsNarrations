the scores achieved by the model on this multi-class classification problem where the test instances are classified as either # ca or # cb or # ca are : accuracy ( 47.92 % ) , recall ( 52.94 % ) , precision ( 34.81 % ) , and finally , an f1score of 45.95 % . these scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly labeling most test cases with only a few misclassification instances .
