the classification performance of the algorithm regarding this binary classification problem where the test instances are classified as either # ca or # cb is as follows : accuracy ( 95.77 % ) , recall ( 95.31 % ) , auc ( 98.62 % ) , and precision ( 95.41 % ) . these scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be very effective at correctly classifying most test cases with only a small margin of error ( actually , the misclassification error rate is only about g-mean % ) .
