the scores achieved by the model on this binary classification task are as follows ( 1 ) accuracy equal to 86.21 % . ( 2 ) specificity score of 92.36 % . ( 3 ) precision score ( 43.58 % ) is only marginally higher than the dummy model that constantly assigns the majority class label # ca to any given test case . this implies that the likelihood of misclassifying samples is quite small which is impressive but not surprising given the distribution of the data across the class labels .
