the scores achieved by the model on this binary classification task are as follows : ( 1 ) accuracy equal to 80.81 % ( 2 ) sensitivity score equal 78.74 % ( 3 ) specificity score of 82.93 % ( 4 ) f1score ( calculated based on recall and specificity ) is 80.95 % . these scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly classifying most test cases / samples with only a small margin of error ( actually , the likelihood of misclassifying test samples is small but not surprising given the data is balanced between the classes .
