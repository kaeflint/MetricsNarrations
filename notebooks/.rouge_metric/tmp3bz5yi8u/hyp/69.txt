the scores achieved by the model on this binary classification task are as follows ( 1 ) accuracy equal to 86.21 % . ( 2 ) specificity score of 92.36 % . ( 3 ) precision score ( 43.58 % ) . ( 4 ) f1score of 62.26 % is a better indicator that this model will be less effective at correctly predicting the true label for the majority of test cases related to any of the class labels . furthermore , the precision and f2score show that the likelihood of misclassifying test samples is very marginal .
