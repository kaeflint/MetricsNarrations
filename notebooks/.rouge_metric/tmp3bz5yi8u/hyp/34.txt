the scores achieved by the model on this binary classification task are as follows ( 1 ) accuracy equal to 80.96 % . ( 2 ) precision score equals 75.21 % . ( 3 ) recall score of 66.97 % . ( 4 ) f1score of 71.04 % . these scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly classifying most test cases / samples with only a small margin of error ( actually , the misclassification error rate is only about g-mean ) .
