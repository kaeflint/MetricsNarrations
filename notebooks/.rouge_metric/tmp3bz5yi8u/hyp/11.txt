the algorithm's ability to correctly classify test samples as either # ca or # cb was assessed based on the metrics accuracy , auc , precision , and sensitivity . it scored 90.73 % , 95.87 % , 90.32 % , 89.13 % and 99.59 % , respectively . these scores support the conclusion that this model will be highly effective at correctly labeling most test cases belonging to any of the classes . furthermore , from the precision and recall scores , we can say that it will likely have a lower false-positive rate .
