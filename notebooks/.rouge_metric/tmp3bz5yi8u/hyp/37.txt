the scores achieved by the model on this binary classification task are as follows ( 1 ) accuracy equal to 78.22 % ( 2 ) auc score of 78.51 % , ( 3 ) sensitivity score ( sometimes referred to as the recall score ) is 82.86 % with a moderately high f1score of 80.86 % . these scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be somewhat effective at correctly labeling most test cases belonging to any of the classes . furthermore , from the precision and sensitivity scores , we can assert that the likelihood of misclassification is quite small , which is impressive but not surprising given the data is balanced between the class labels under consideration .
