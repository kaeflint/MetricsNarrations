the performance of the classifier on this multi-class classification problem where the test instances are classified as either # ca or # cb or # ca is : accuracy ( 86.21 % ) , recall ( 82.03 % ) , precision ( 72.84 % ) , and finally , an f1score of 76.64 % . these scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly predicting the true label for several test cases / samples with only a small margin of error .
