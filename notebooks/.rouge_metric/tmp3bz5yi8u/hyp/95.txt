the classifier's performance on this multi-class classification problem where the test instances are classified as either # ca or # cb or # ca is : accuracy ( 72.44 % ) , recall ( 73.51 % ) , and finally , an f1score of 71.94 % . these scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly labeling most test cases belonging to any of the class labels . furthermore , from the f1score and recall scores , we can see that the likelihood of misclassifying any given test case is quite small .
