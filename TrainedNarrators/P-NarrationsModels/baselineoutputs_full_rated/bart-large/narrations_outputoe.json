This assertion is further supported by the trade-off score achieved for the specificity metric (i.e. sensitivity). Therefore based on all metrics' scores not seen here but judging base on them alone it could be concluded that the algorithm has somewhat lower performance in terms of accurately generating the true labels for most test samples drawn from any of the classes #CA, #CB and #CC considering the difference between recall/sensitivity and precision scores today hence will have some instances falling below the acceptable threshold rate.
