Besides looking at F1score and precision scores, confidence in predictions related to label #CB is very high.

The precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1score show that the likelihood of misclassifying test samples is very low leading to a higher confidence in prediction output decisions for the examples under each label.

However, from the precision score we can see that some examples belongingto #CB are likely to be mislabeled as #CA considering the difference between recall and precision scores.
