In addition, based on the recall (sensitivity) and precision scores, we can assert that the likelihood of misclassifying any given input test example is quite small which is impressive but not surprising given the data was balanced.", "For this classification problem, accuracy, recall, F1score and precision are the evaluation metrics employed to assess the performance of the model. With respective to the precision and recall scores, the classifier scored 76.81% (i.e. Recall). Besides, it also has an F1score of about76.03%. Judging based on the scores achieved, we can conclude that this model has a high classification performance and will be very effective at correctly picking the true label for new or unseen examples."]}
