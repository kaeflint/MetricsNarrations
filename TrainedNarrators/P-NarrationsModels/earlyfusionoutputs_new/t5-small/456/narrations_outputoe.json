These scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly labeling most test cases with only a few misclassification instances.", "The classifier's performance scores on this multi-class classification problem where the test instances are classified as either #CA or #CB or #CC are as follows: Accuracy (76.44%), Recall (76.83%), and a Precision score equal to 77.81%. These scores support the conclusion that this model will be moderately effective at correctly labeling most test cases drawn from any of the classes. Furthermore, from the F2score and precision scores, we can see that the likelihood of misclassifying any given test case is marginal."]}
