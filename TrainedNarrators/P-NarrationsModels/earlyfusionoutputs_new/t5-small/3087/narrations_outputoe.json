These scores support the conclusion that this model will be moderately effective at correctly labeling most unseen or new examples. In other words, it has a lower misclassification error rate.", "The performance of the classifier on this multi-class classification problem where the test instances are classified as either #CA or #CB or #CA is: Accuracy (73.78%), Precision (79.09%), and Recall (73.77%). These scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly labeling most test cases with only a small margin of error. Furthermore, the precision and recall scores show that the likelihood of misclassifying any given test example is lower.", "The classification performance of the algorithm regarding this multi-class classification problem where the test instances are classified as either #CA or #CB or #CA is: Accuracy (72.01%), Recall (72.56%), precision (73.06%) and finally, an F1score of 71.54%. These scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly labeling most test cases with only a few misclassification errors.", "The classification performance of the algorithm regarding this multi-class classification problem where the test instances are classified as either #CA or #CB or #CA is: Accuracy is 76.44%; Recall is 76.83%; Precision score is 75.81 with an F1score equal to 76.03%. These scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly labeling most unseen or new examples. Furthermore, the precision and recall scores show that the likelihood of misclassifying any given test example is lower."]}
