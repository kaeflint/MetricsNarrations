(b) Precision score of 79.09%. These scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly sorting out the examples belonging to any of the three-class labels ( #CA, #CB, and #CC ). Furthermore, from the recall and precision scores, we can conclude that the likelihood of misclassifying any given test case is very low.", "The performance assessment scores achieved by the model on this binary classification task are as follows: (a) Accuracy equal to 72.01%. (b) Precision score equal 73.06%; (c) F1score of 71.54%. These scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly predicting the true labels for several test cases with only a small margin of misclassification error. Furthermore, from the precision and recall scores, we can conclude that it has a moderately low false-positive rate.", "The evaluation scores achieved by the model on this multi-class classification problem are as follows: (a) Accuracy equal to 76.44%. (b) Precision score of 76,81%; (c) Recall score with a moderate F1score of76.03%. These scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly predicting the true labels for the majority of test cases related to any of the classes under consideration. Furthermore, from the precision and recall scores, we can conclude that the likelihood of misclassifying any given test case is very low."]}
