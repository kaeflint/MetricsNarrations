In summary, from all metrics' statements above one might say its confidence in predictions related to label #CB will likely increase moderately given how good or precise the classifier is at generating true labels for several samples drawn randomly from both categories #CA and #CC as shown here.

In summary, there are more instances where the classifier misclassifies cases belonging to label #CB than those related to #CB (i.e., Accuracy score equal to about 43%). Overall, its prediction confidence level should be moderately good given how poor the dataset could possibly get when trained for such imbalanced data/samples.

In summary, there are high confidence in its output decisions for several examples belonging to label #CB (i.e., the majority classifier). However looking at accuracy alone one might be tempted not to trust predictions made here given how poor they were when trained with reference data derived from the classes under consideration.

In summary, confidence in predictions related to label #CB can't really be ignored given how good they are across all the evaluation metric/samples here.
