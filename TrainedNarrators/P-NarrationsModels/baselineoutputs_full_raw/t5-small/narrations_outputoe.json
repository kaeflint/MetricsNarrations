These scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly classifying most test cases/samples with only a small margin of error (the misclassification error rate is only about F2score ).",
        "For this multi-class classification task (where a given test observation is labeled as either #CA or #CB or #CC or #CA ), the model has: Accuracy (76.44%), Recall (76.83%), and finally, an F1score of 76.03%. These scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective in terms of its prediction power for the majority of test cases/samples. Furthermore, the precision and recall scores show that the likelihood of misclassifying test samples is lower."
