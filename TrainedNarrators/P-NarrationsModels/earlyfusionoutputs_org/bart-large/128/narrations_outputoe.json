The scores across these metrics suggest that it will be able to correctly identify a fair amount of examples belonging to both classes with only marginal misclassification error rate, which is very impressive given how imbalanced the dataset was when trained for this task in 2014/15. In summary, we can conclude from all above statements that this model has high confidence regarding its prediction decisions related to label #CB and #CC cases. Furthermore based upon precision and sensitivity values achieved, there should also be little chance of false negatives occurring due to sampling biases against any of the two labels under consideration here; however, some cases might need further investigation before deployment into production or distribution decision-making steps.
