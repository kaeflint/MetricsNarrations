(b) Recall score of 73.51%; (c) F1score of 71.94%. From the scores across the different metrics under consideration, we can conclude that this model will be moderately effective at correctly predicting the true labels for several test cases with only a few misclassification errors.", "The performance of the classifier on this binary classification problem where the test instances are classified as either #CA or #CB is: (a) Accuracy equal to 72.44%. (b) Recall score is 73.51%; (c) Precision score of 77.01%. From the recall and precision scores, we can see that the model has a moderately low false-positive rate. This implies that it will likely misclassify only a small number of test cases related to the different classes.", "On this multi-class classification problem, where the test instances are classified as either #CA or #CB or #CC, the classifier has an accuracy of 73.78% with a recall and precision score equal to 74.77% and 79.09%, respectively. Based on the scores across the different metrics under consideration, we can conclude that this model will be moderately effective at correctly predicting the true labels for several test cases.", "On this multi-class classification problem, where the test instances are classified as either #CA or #CB or #CC, the classifier has an accuracy of 72.01% with a precision score of 73.06% and an F1score of 71.54%. Based on the scores across the different metrics under consideration, we can conclude that this model will likely misclassify only a small number of test cases related to any of the classes.", "On this multi-class classification problem, where the test instances are classified as either #CA or #CB or #CC, the classifier has an accuracy of 76.44% with the recall and precision scores equal to 75.83% and 77.81%, respectively. The scores across the different metrics suggest that this model will be moderately effective at correctly predicting the true labels for several test cases related to any of the three classes."]}
